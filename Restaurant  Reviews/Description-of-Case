Restaurant Reviews


Restaurant Xred have too many customers and they sell too many meals 
every day. That is why it increases the number of meals and service types 
for customers and it attracts the people. But the increase of the customers 
make it hard to know customer satisfaction. Xredâ€™s main goal is customer 
satisfaction. So they made a survey about the service and meals. Now, they 
want to easily know that customer reviews are positive or negative.
