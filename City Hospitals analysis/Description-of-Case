City Hospitals analysis



City growth affects each city's hospitals, schools etc. This growth happens because 
of the people's demands. Because of this growth it affects the price of 
everything. So the government wants to open a new hospital but first of all they 
want to see information about the number of each regional hospital , over the age 
analysis and each department's sum of deposit.
