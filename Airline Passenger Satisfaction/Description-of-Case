Airline Passenger Satisfaction


Airline companies have many passengers and service and customer 
satisfaction is always top of mind for the company. Unhappy or disengaged 
customers naturally mean fewer passengers and less revenue. Itâ€™s 
important for the company that customers have an excellent experience 
every time they travel. On-time flights, good in-flight entertainment, more 
(and better) snacks, and more legroom might be the obvious contributors to 
a good experience and more loyalty. So, the airline company wants to 
know if passengers will be satisfied or not from the flight.
