Credit Card Recommendation in Banking

“Golden Horizon Bank” is a private bank which provides various products to its
customers, such as savings accounts, home loans, car loans, credit cards and so on.
Currently, the new manager of the bank identified that the income from credit
cards is quite low compared to the other services. He made the decision to take
some actions to increase credit card earnings. The first step he decided is to
recommend credit cards to the bank's customers rather than to new customers,
because they already have trust in the company. As the manager knows the
capability and potential of data in banking, he instructed the data science team
lead to build a model that predicts which customers are more likely to buy credit
cards and the team lead appointed you to this task. Try to build a model which
helps the bank to get maximum out of the efforts in selling more credit cards
