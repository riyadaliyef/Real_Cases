Cancer prediction

Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts 
for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts 
when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors 
that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

The hospital wants to know if tumors are classified into MALIGANT (cancerous) or BENIGN (non-cancerous).
